# No-comment
A list of filters to block comments on various websites

## What is this?
No-comment is a handmade list of filters that you can import into your browser with your favourite adblocker extension. It blocks the possibility to view comments by third-party users on websites, so that you can focus on what you really came for.

## Scope and limitations
This list was initially created for personal use only. As such, for now, it doesn't block a lot, but it's supposed to grow and evolve as time goes on.
Currently, it does works on the following:
- YouTube
- all websites using the Disqus comment system
- various popular french and french-speaking news websites

## How to use

No-comment can be imported into your modern browser of choice on any OS, as long as you have an "adblocking" extension installed (or a filtering system integrated in your browser). Most adblocking extensions use the same syntax for filters, so it should Just Workâ„¢ with most. I personally recommend using uBlock Origin.

Just import the following URL into your list of custom filters:

## Contributions
You're absolutely welcome to submit new filter rules as pull requests. All rules are welcome as long as they do intend to block comments, no matter how (un)known the website is!
