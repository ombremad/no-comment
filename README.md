## What is this?
*Everyone has an opinion. But do you really need to know?*

No-comment is a handmade list of filters that you can import into your browser with your favourite adblocker extension. It blocks the possibility to view comments by third-party users, on websites where the primary intent is NOT to chat and to comment (ie. video sharing or news websites).

## Scope and limitations
This list was initially created for personal use only. As such, for now, it doesn't block a lot, but it's supposed to grow and evolve as time goes on.
Currently, it does works on the following:
- YouTube
- websites using the Disqus comment system
- various popular english- and french-speaking news outlets

## How to use

No-comment can be imported into your modern browser of choice on any OS, as long as you have an "adblocking" extension installed (or a filtering system integrated in your browser). Most adblocking extensions use the same syntax for filters, so it should Just Workâ„¢ with most. I personally recommend using [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com).

Just import the following URL into your list of custom filters:

You're absolutely welcome to submit new filter rules as pull requests. All rules are welcome as long as they do intend to block comments, no matter how (un)known the website is!
